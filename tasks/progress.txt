# Ralph Progress Log - Scenario Library Expansion

Branch: ralph/epic1-scenario-library
Feature: Expand scenario library from 14 to 112 scenarios across 5 domains
Started: 2026-01-22

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create centralized scenario data file with extended interface
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Created a centralized scenario data file (`src/data/scenarios.ts`) with an extended TypeScript interface that supports all 112 scenarios across 5 domains (Foreign Languages, English Communication, Cross-Cultural Communication, Leadership, Ethics & Philosophy).

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - **NEW FILE** Created centralized scenario data file with:
  - Extended Scenario interface with core fields (id, title, subtitle, course, difficulty, difficultyLevel, description, image, area, courseCode)
  - Common new fields (situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags)
  - Language-specific fields (language, semester, actflLevel, ilrLevel, cefrLevel, gseRange, keyVocabulary, culturalTips, culturalGotchas)
  - Moved all 14 existing scenarios from MidshipmanScenarios.tsx to centralized file
  - Exported `scenarios` array and `Scenario` type
  - Added helper functions: getScenarioById, getScenariosByArea, getScenariosByCourse, getScenariosByLanguage, getScenariosBySemester

### Learnings for future iterations
- The Scenario type was previously not exported from App.tsx despite being imported by mockScenarios.ts and other components - this created a silent TypeScript issue
- The new centralized file provides a single source of truth for scenario data structure
- Optional fields (using `?`) allow backward compatibility with existing 14 scenarios while supporting new language-specific fields
- Helper functions make it easy to filter scenarios by various dimensions (area, course, language, semester)
- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors

- Course codes: HE111, HE112, NL420
- Placeholder images ("placeholder" for all scenarios without Figma assets)
- Appropriate difficulty progression: HE-111/112 scenarios are INT (2-3/5), NL-420 scenarios escalate from INT (3/5) to HARD (4-5/5)

### Learnings for future iterations
- English communication scenarios focus exclusively on oral skills (not written), addressing identified USNA weakness
- HE-111/112 scenarios emphasize classical rhetoric: logos (logic), ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), active listening, academic discourse
- NL-420 scenarios emphasize military communication frameworks: BLUF, SALUTE reports, decision briefs, difficult conversations, media relations, transparent leadership
- Communication scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields (no semester, actflLevel, etc.) - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Difficulty levels appropriately reflect communication challenge: academic debate (INT 2-3/5), operational briefing (INT 3/5), difficult conversations (HARD 4-5/5)
- NL-420 scenarios include specific communication frameworks in the frameworks array: "BLUF", "SALUTE Report", "5 W's", "PCE"
- HE-111 scenarios test intellectual skills (argumentation, rebuttal, analysis) while NL-420 tests leadership communication (briefing, counseling, media, town halls)
- Placeholder images will be used until Figma assets are created for communication scenarios
- Area field uses "Communication" (new domain, different from "Language", "Ethics", "Leadership", "Philosophy")
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 9 scenarios added
- Total scenario count: 14 existing + 56 language + 9 communication = 79 scenarios (33 more needed for 112 total)

  - fas-ea-001: The Consensus (HARD 4/5) - Japanese nemawashi (consensus-building) in US-Japan alliance
  - fas-mena-001: The Honor Code (HARD 4/5) - Honor/shame dynamics and face-saving in Gulf partnerships
  - fas-la-001: The Personalismo (INT 3/5) - Relationship-centered business in Latin America

### All scenarios include
- Full scenario fields: situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags
- Area field: "Cross-Cultural" (new domain for scenario filtering)
- Course codes: NE203, NL360, FAS (East Asia), FAS (MENA), FAS (Latin America), FAS (Africa), FAS (Europe)
- Placeholder images ("placeholder" for all scenarios without Figma assets)
- Appropriate difficulty progression: NE-203 scenarios INT (3/5), NL-360 scenarios range INT (2-3/5) to HARD (4/5), FAS scenarios range INT (3/5) to HARD (4/5)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Cross-cultural scenarios focus on Operational Cultural Proficiency (OCP) - critical for lethality, force protection, and maneuverability
- NE-203 scenarios address cross-cultural ethics: moral perception differences, trust-building across cultural boundaries
- NL-360 scenarios emphasize leadership across cultures: multinational teams, partnership adaptation, interpreters, ceremonies
- FAS scenarios test regional expertise across 5 AORs: East Asia (nemawashi), MENA (honor/shame), Latin America (personalismo), Africa (collective decision-making), Europe (communication styles)
- Cross-cultural scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields (no semester, actflLevel, etc.) - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Cross-cultural competency framework includes: Knowledge (cultural facts), Awareness (recognizing factors), Attitudes (respect), Skills (adaptability)
- Difficulty levels appropriately reflect cultural complexity: basic ceremonies (INT 2/5), relationship-building (INT 3/5), navigating honor/shame or consensus processes (HARD 4/5)
- Frameworks array includes cultural concepts: "Nemawashi", "Honor Culture", "Personalismo", "Moral Perception", "Cultural Protocols"
- Regional FAS scenarios authentically represent cultural patterns: Japanese consensus, MENA face-saving, Latin American relationship focus, African collective decision-making, European communication variation
- All scenarios address English-speaking cross-cultural contexts (culture without language barriers) or situations requiring pure cultural navigation
- Area field uses "Cross-Cultural" (new domain, different from "Language", "Communication", "Ethics", "Leadership", "Philosophy")
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 12 scenarios added
- Total scenario count: 14 existing + 56 language + 9 communication + 12 cross-cultural = 91 scenarios (21 more needed for 112 total)

## Iteration 11 - US-011: Add leadership course scenarios (13 scenarios)
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added 13 leadership course scenarios to src/data/scenarios.ts covering the four-year leadership development journey at USNA. Scenarios span from freshman year (NL-110: "Who am I?") through senior year (NL-400: "Lead an Organization") plus leadership electives.

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - Added 13 leadership scenarios:

  **NL-110: Applied Behavioral Science - 4/C Freshman (4 scenarios)**
  - nl110-w03-001: System 1 Trap (EASY 2/5) - Recognizing automatic thinking bias (Kahneman framework)
  - nl110-w05-001: The Attachment Pattern (INT 2/5) - Understanding relationship foundations and attachment theory
  - nl110-w08-001: The Values Clarification (INT 2/5) - Articulating personal values authentically
  - nl110-w12-001: Farsi Island (Enlisted) (INT 3/5) - Followership perspective on flagship case study

  **NL-310: Organizational Behavior - 2/C Junior (4 scenarios)**
  - nl310-w06-001: The Climate Survey (INT 3/5) - Interpreting organizational climate survey data
  - nl310-w09-001: The Counseling (HARD 4/5) - Mentoring underperforming sailor with personal issues
  - nl310-w11-001: Toxic Leadership Recognition (HARD 5/5) - Navigating toxic superior officer

  **NL-400: Law for the Naval Leader - 1/C Senior (3 scenarios)**
  - nl400-w04-001: Captain's Mast (HARD 4/5) - Non-judicial punishment recommendation decision
  - nl400-w08-001: The Double Tap (HARD 5/5) - LOAC targeting decision under time pressure
  - nl400-w12-001: Farsi Island (Legal) (HARD 4/5) - Legal analysis of flagship case (surrender, detention law)

  **Leadership Electives (2 scenarios)**
  - nl425-w10-001: Engineering Leadership Crisis (HARD 5/5) - Technical authority under operational pressure (NL-425)
  - nl311-w08-001: Psychology of Leadership Interview (INT 3/5) - Self-reflection on leadership development (NL-311)

### All scenarios include
- Full scenario fields: situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags
- Area field: "Leadership" (existing domain)
- Course codes: NL110, NL310, NL400, NL425, NL311
- Placeholder images ("placeholder" for all scenarios without Figma assets)
- Appropriate difficulty progression: NL-110 scenarios EASY-INT (2-3/5), NL-310 scenarios INT-HARD (3-5/5), NL-400 scenarios HARD (4-5/5)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Leadership scenarios follow USNA's four-year developmental philosophy:
  - **NL-110 (4/C Freshman):** "What it means to be a person" - Self-knowledge, followership, cognitive frameworks
  - **NL-310 (2/C Junior):** "Lead Others" - Small team leadership, organizational behavior, climate
  - **NL-400 (1/C Senior):** "Lead an Organization" - Authority, responsibility, law, UCMJ, LOAC
- Farsi Island appears as flagship case across multiple years with different lenses:
  - NL-110: Enlisted perspective (followership, influence without authority)
  - NL-400: Legal analysis (detention law, code of conduct, LOAC)
  - Also appears in NE-203 (ethics - four moral factors)
- Leadership scenarios emphasize self-awareness frameworks: System 1/System 2 (Kahneman), Attachment Theory, Values Clarification, MBTI/StrengthsFinder
- NL-310 scenarios address realistic organizational challenges: climate surveys, performance counseling, toxic leadership, change management
- NL-400 scenarios apply military law: UCMJ/NJP (Captain's Mast), LOAC (targeting decisions), Code of Conduct (detention)
- Engineering leadership scenario (NL-425) connects to Challenger disaster case study - technical authority and moral courage
- Difficulty levels appropriately reflect leadership complexity: self-reflection (INT 2-3/5), organizational leadership (INT 3/5 to HARD 4/5), legal/life-or-death decisions (HARD 4-5/5)
- Frameworks array includes leadership concepts: "System 1/System 2", "Attachment Theory", "Toxic Leadership", "LOAC", "UCMJ", "Change Management"
- Leadership scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Area field uses "Leadership" (existing domain from original 14 scenarios)
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 13 scenarios added
- Total scenario count: 14 existing + 56 language + 9 communication + 12 cross-cultural + 13 leadership = 104 scenarios (8 more needed for 112 total)
