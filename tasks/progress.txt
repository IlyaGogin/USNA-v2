# Ralph Progress Log - Scenario Library Expansion

Branch: ralph/epic1-scenario-library
Feature: Expand scenario library from 14 to 112 scenarios across 5 domains
Started: 2026-01-22

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create centralized scenario data file with extended interface
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Created a centralized scenario data file (`src/data/scenarios.ts`) with an extended TypeScript interface that supports all 112 scenarios across 5 domains (Foreign Languages, English Communication, Cross-Cultural Communication, Leadership, Ethics & Philosophy).

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - **NEW FILE** Created centralized scenario data file with:
  - Extended Scenario interface with core fields (id, title, subtitle, course, difficulty, difficultyLevel, description, image, area, courseCode)
  - Common new fields (situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags)
  - Language-specific fields (language, semester, actflLevel, ilrLevel, cefrLevel, gseRange, keyVocabulary, culturalTips, culturalGotchas)
  - Moved all 14 existing scenarios from MidshipmanScenarios.tsx to centralized file
  - Exported `scenarios` array and `Scenario` type
  - Added helper functions: getScenarioById, getScenariosByArea, getScenariosByCourse, getScenariosByLanguage, getScenariosBySemester

### Learnings for future iterations
- The Scenario type was previously not exported from App.tsx despite being imported by mockScenarios.ts and other components - this created a silent TypeScript issue
- The new centralized file provides a single source of truth for scenario data structure
- Optional fields (using `?`) allow backward compatibility with existing 14 scenarios while supporting new language-specific fields
- Helper functions make it easy to filter scenarios by various dimensions (area, course, language, semester)
- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Add Japanese language scenarios (8 scenarios)
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added 8 Japanese language scenarios to src/data/scenarios.ts covering all 4 semesters (FJ-101 through FJ-202), progressing from Novice Mid (S1) to Intermediate High (S4). Each scenario includes full language-specific metadata and cultural guidance.

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - Added 8 Japanese scenarios:
  - fj101-l01-001: First Meeting (S1, Novice Mid, A1, GSE 22-29)
  - fj101-l01-002: At the Base Cafeteria (S1, Novice Mid, A1, GSE 22-29)
  - fj102-l02-001: The Dinner Invitation (S2, Novice High, A2, GSE 30-35)
  - fj102-l02-002: Schedule Conflict (S2, Novice High, A2, GSE 30-35)
  - fj201-l03-001: The Disagreement (S3, Intermediate Low, B1, GSE 36-50)
  - fj201-l03-002: JMSDF Liaison Meeting (S3, Intermediate Mid, B1, GSE 36-50)
  - fj202-l04-001: Crisis Communication (S4, Intermediate High, B1+, GSE 51-58)
  - fj202-l04-002: Cross-Cultural Conflict Resolution (S4, Intermediate High, B1+, GSE 51-58)

### All scenarios include
- Language-specific fields: language="Japanese", semester (1-4), actflLevel, ilrLevel, cefrLevel, gseRange
- Cultural preparation: keyVocabulary arrays (5-7 essential phrases with romanization and translation)
- culturalTips arrays (5 do's for each scenario)
- culturalGotchas arrays (5 don'ts to avoid cultural mistakes)
- Full scenario fields: situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags

### Learnings for future iterations
- Placeholder images used consistently ("placeholder") for scenarios without Figma assets
- Proficiency progression is realistic: S1/S2 focus on survival Japanese (greetings, ordering, invitations), S3/S4 advance to professional contexts (disagreement, briefings, crisis, mediation)
- Cultural content is authentic and operationally relevant (JMSDF partnership, joint exercises, liaison roles)
- Difficulty levels scale appropriately: S1/S2 are EASY (1-2/5), S3 is INT (3/5), S4 is HARD (4/5)
- ILR levels map correctly: 0+ (Novice), 1 (Novice High), 1+/2 (Intermediate), 2+ (Intermediate High)
- Area field uses "Language" (not "Foreign Languages") to match expected domain naming

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Add Chinese language scenarios (8 scenarios)
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added 8 Chinese language scenarios to src/data/scenarios.ts covering all 4 semesters (FC-101 through FC-202), progressing from Novice Mid (S1) to Intermediate High (S4). Each scenario includes full language-specific metadata, cultural guidance, and operational military contexts specific to Indo-Pacific engagement.

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - Added 8 Chinese scenarios:
  - fc101-l01-001: First Meeting at the Embassy (S1, Novice Mid, A1, GSE 22-29) - Diplomatic reception self-introduction
  - fc101-l01-002: Navigating Beijing (S1, Novice Mid, A1, GSE 22-29) - Survival Chinese for directions and transactions
  - fc102-l02-001: The Banquet (S2, Novice High, A2, GSE 30-35) - Chinese banquet etiquette and toasting culture
  - fc102-l02-002: The Misunderstanding (S2, Novice High, A2, GSE 30-35) - Apology culture and face management
  - fc201-l03-001: The Naval Port Visit (S3, Intermediate Low, B1, GSE 36-50) - Military diplomacy at PLAN base
  - fc201-l03-002: Regional Security Discussion (S3, Intermediate Mid, B1, GSE 36-50) - Academic security conference participation
  - fc202-l04-001: Community Relations Crisis (S4, Intermediate High, B1+, GSE 51-58) - De-escalating community tensions
  - fc202-l04-002: Bilateral Negotiation (S4, Intermediate High, B1+, GSE 51-58) - Maritime incident prevention negotiation

### All scenarios include
- Language-specific fields: language="Chinese", semester (1-4), actflLevel, ilrLevel, cefrLevel, gseRange
- Cultural preparation: keyVocabulary arrays (5-7 essential phrases with pinyin romanization and translation)
- culturalTips arrays (5 do's for each scenario)
- culturalGotchas arrays (5 don'ts to avoid cultural mistakes)
- Full scenario fields: situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags

### Learnings for future iterations
- Placeholder images used consistently ("placeholder") for scenarios without Figma assets
- Chinese scenarios emphasize face management (面子), relationship building (关系), and indirect communication patterns
- Proficiency progression realistic: S1/S2 focus on survival Chinese (greetings, navigation, dining), S3/S4 advance to professional/diplomatic contexts (military exchanges, academic discourse, crisis management, negotiation)
- Cultural content is operationally relevant for Indo-Pacific AOR (PLAN interactions, regional security, community relations)
- Difficulty levels scale appropriately: S1 is EASY (1/5), S2 is INT (2/5), S3 is INT (3/5), S4 is HARD (4/5)
- ILR levels map correctly: 0+ (Novice Mid), 1 (Novice High), 1+/2 (Intermediate Low-Mid), 2+ (Intermediate High)
- Chinese scenarios include sensitive topic navigation (Taiwan, South China Sea) with diplomatic redirection language
- Academic Chinese scenarios use hedging language and personal framing to avoid representing official policy
- Area field uses "Language" (consistent with Japanese scenarios) for filtering purposes
