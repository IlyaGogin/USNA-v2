# Ralph Progress Log - Scenario Library Expansion

Branch: ralph/epic1-scenario-library
Feature: Expand scenario library from 14 to 112 scenarios across 5 domains
Started: 2026-01-22

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create centralized scenario data file with extended interface
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Created a centralized scenario data file (`src/data/scenarios.ts`) with an extended TypeScript interface that supports all 112 scenarios across 5 domains (Foreign Languages, English Communication, Cross-Cultural Communication, Leadership, Ethics & Philosophy).

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - **NEW FILE** Created centralized scenario data file with:
  - Extended Scenario interface with core fields (id, title, subtitle, course, difficulty, difficultyLevel, description, image, area, courseCode)
  - Common new fields (situation, dilemma, briefing, frameworks, primaryMission, successCriteria, tags)
  - Language-specific fields (language, semester, actflLevel, ilrLevel, cefrLevel, gseRange, keyVocabulary, culturalTips, culturalGotchas)
  - Moved all 14 existing scenarios from MidshipmanScenarios.tsx to centralized file
  - Exported `scenarios` array and `Scenario` type
  - Added helper functions: getScenarioById, getScenariosByArea, getScenariosByCourse, getScenariosByLanguage, getScenariosBySemester

### Learnings for future iterations
- The Scenario type was previously not exported from App.tsx despite being imported by mockScenarios.ts and other components - this created a silent TypeScript issue
- The new centralized file provides a single source of truth for scenario data structure
- Optional fields (using `?`) allow backward compatibility with existing 14 scenarios while supporting new language-specific fields
- Helper functions make it easy to filter scenarios by various dimensions (area, course, language, semester)
- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors

- Course codes: HE111, HE112, NL420
- Placeholder images ("placeholder" for all scenarios without Figma assets)
- Appropriate difficulty progression: HE-111/112 scenarios are INT (2-3/5), NL-420 scenarios escalate from INT (3/5) to HARD (4-5/5)

### Learnings for future iterations
- English communication scenarios focus exclusively on oral skills (not written), addressing identified USNA weakness
- HE-111/112 scenarios emphasize classical rhetoric: logos (logic), ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), active listening, academic discourse
- NL-420 scenarios emphasize military communication frameworks: BLUF, SALUTE reports, decision briefs, difficult conversations, media relations, transparent leadership
- Communication scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields (no semester, actflLevel, etc.) - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Difficulty levels appropriately reflect communication challenge: academic debate (INT 2-3/5), operational briefing (INT 3/5), difficult conversations (HARD 4-5/5)
- NL-420 scenarios include specific communication frameworks in the frameworks array: "BLUF", "SALUTE Report", "5 W's", "PCE"
- HE-111 scenarios test intellectual skills (argumentation, rebuttal, analysis) while NL-420 tests leadership communication (briefing, counseling, media, town halls)
- Placeholder images will be used until Figma assets are created for communication scenarios
- Area field uses "Communication" (new domain, different from "Language", "Ethics", "Leadership", "Philosophy")
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 9 scenarios added
- Total scenario count: 14 existing + 56 language + 9 communication = 79 scenarios (33 more needed for 112 total)

- Appropriate difficulty progression: NE-203 scenarios INT (3/5), NL-360 scenarios range INT (2-3/5) to HARD (4/5), FAS scenarios range INT (3/5) to HARD (4/5)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Cross-cultural scenarios focus on Operational Cultural Proficiency (OCP) - critical for lethality, force protection, and maneuverability
- NE-203 scenarios address cross-cultural ethics: moral perception differences, trust-building across cultural boundaries
- NL-360 scenarios emphasize leadership across cultures: multinational teams, partnership adaptation, interpreters, ceremonies
- FAS scenarios test regional expertise across 5 AORs: East Asia (nemawashi), MENA (honor/shame), Latin America (personalismo), Africa (collective decision-making), Europe (communication styles)
- Cross-cultural scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields (no semester, actflLevel, etc.) - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Cross-cultural competency framework includes: Knowledge (cultural facts), Awareness (recognizing factors), Attitudes (respect), Skills (adaptability)
- Difficulty levels appropriately reflect cultural complexity: basic ceremonies (INT 2/5), relationship-building (INT 3/5), navigating honor/shame or consensus processes (HARD 4/5)
- Frameworks array includes cultural concepts: "Nemawashi", "Honor Culture", "Personalismo", "Moral Perception", "Cultural Protocols"
- Regional FAS scenarios authentically represent cultural patterns: Japanese consensus, MENA face-saving, Latin American relationship focus, African collective decision-making, European communication variation
- All scenarios address English-speaking cross-cultural contexts (culture without language barriers) or situations requiring pure cultural navigation
- Area field uses "Cross-Cultural" (new domain, different from "Language", "Communication", "Ethics", "Leadership", "Philosophy")
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 12 scenarios added
- Total scenario count: 14 existing + 56 language + 9 communication + 12 cross-cultural = 91 scenarios (21 more needed for 112 total)

  - **NL-110 (4/C Freshman):** "What it means to be a person" - Self-knowledge, followership, cognitive frameworks
  - **NL-310 (2/C Junior):** "Lead Others" - Small team leadership, organizational behavior, climate
  - **NL-400 (1/C Senior):** "Lead an Organization" - Authority, responsibility, law, UCMJ, LOAC
- Farsi Island appears as flagship case across multiple years with different lenses:
  - NL-110: Enlisted perspective (followership, influence without authority)
  - NL-400: Legal analysis (detention law, code of conduct, LOAC)
  - Also appears in NE-203 (ethics - four moral factors)

**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added 8 ethics & philosophy elective scenarios to src/data/scenarios.ts, completing the 112-scenario library expansion. These scenarios provide deep philosophical exploration of military ethics for midshipmen who have completed the required NE-203 course and are ready for advanced ethical reasoning.

### Files changed
- `src/data/scenarios.ts` - Added 8 philosophy elective scenarios:

  **NP-232: Military Ethics - Code of the Warrior (2 scenarios)**
  - np232-w05-001: The Warrior's Code (HARD 4/5) - Comparative warrior ethics across cultures (bushido, chivalry, agoge)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Philosophy elective scenarios assume completion of NE-203 and readiness for upper-level philosophical discussion
- All philosophy scenarios are HARD difficulty (4-5/5) - appropriate for advanced ethical reasoning with faculty mentors
- Scenarios emphasize Socratic dialogue rather than right/wrong answers - multiple defensible positions exist
- NP-232 scenarios explore comparative warrior ethics: bushido, chivalry, Spartan traditions, and modern professional ethics
- NP-350 scenarios focus on Stockdale's application of Stoic philosophy (Epictetus) as POW and practical value of philosophical preparation
- NP-410 scenarios apply Just War Theory rigorously: jus ad bellum (criteria for going to war) and jus in bello (conduct in war)
- NP-430 scenario requires most sophisticated ethical analysis - engaging charitably with strongest arguments before critiquing
- NP-440 scenario addresses Stoic value theory paradox: how to care about military outcomes while viewing them as "preferred indifferents"
- Frameworks array includes philosophical concepts: "Warrior Ethics", "Stoicism", "Epictetus", "Just War Theory", "Jus Ad Bellum", "Jus In Bello", "Doctrine of Double Effect", "Stoic Value Theory"
- Philosophy scenarios do NOT use language-specific fields - those are only for foreign language scenarios
- Area field uses "Philosophy" (existing domain from original 14 scenarios)
- TypeScript build passes successfully with all 8 scenarios added

## Iteration 13 - US-013: Update MidshipmanScenarios to use centralized data
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Updated MidshipmanScenarios.tsx component to import scenarios from the centralized data file (@/data/scenarios) instead of maintaining an inline scenarios array. The component now dynamically generates areas and courses arrays from the scenario data, making all 112 scenarios available with the new domain areas.

### Files changed
- `src/components/MidshipmanScenarios.tsx` - Updated to use centralized scenario data:
  - Added import: `import { scenarios } from "../data/scenarios"`
  - Removed inline scenarios array (200 lines removed)
  - Changed areas array from hardcoded to dynamically generated: `Array.from(new Set(scenarios.map(s => s.area))).sort()`
  - Changed courses array from hardcoded to dynamically generated: `Array.from(new Set(scenarios.map(s => s.courseCode))).sort()`
  - Removed unused Figma image imports (images now come from centralized file)
  - Existing filtering logic continues to work unchanged (filters by selectedAreas, selectedCourses, searchQuery)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Dynamic array generation from scenario data ensures filters automatically update when new scenarios are added
- The component now has access to all 112 scenarios from the centralized file
- New areas are now available in the filter: Language, Communication, Cross-Cultural, Philosophy (in addition to existing Ethics, Leadership)
- New course codes automatically appear in the course filter: all foreign language courses (FJ101-FJ202, FC101-FC202, FA101-FA202, FR101-FR202, FF101-FF202, FG101-FG202, FS101-FS202), English communication courses (HE111, HE112, NL420), cross-cultural courses (NE203, NL360, FAS), additional leadership courses (NL110, NL310, NL400, NL425, NL311), and philosophy courses (NP232, NP350, NP410, NP430, NP440)
- Removed 200 lines of code by eliminating inline scenario duplication
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors
- Existing component functionality preserved - no breaking changes to filtering, search, or display logic


---

## Iteration 14 - US-014: Add language filter dropdown to scenario browser
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added a Language filter to the MidshipmanScenarios sidebar, allowing midshipmen to filter scenarios by specific language (Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, French, German, Spanish). The filter follows the same toggle pattern as Area and Course filters.

### Files changed
- `src/components/MidshipmanScenarios.tsx` - Added language filter functionality:
  - Added `languages` array extraction from scenarios: `Array.from(new Set(scenarios.filter(s => s.language).map(s => s.language))).sort()`
  - Added `selectedLanguages` state array: `useState<string[]>([])`
  - Added `toggleLanguage` function following existing toggle pattern
  - Updated filtering logic to include `matchesLanguage` condition
  - Added Language filter section in sidebar between Area and Course filters
  - Filter UI follows exact same pattern as Area and Course filters (toggle buttons with selected state highlighting)

### UI Verification
- Screenshot: tmp/us-014-scenarios.png (initial scenarios page)
- Screenshot: tmp/us-014-japanese-filter.png (filtered to Japanese only)
- Elements verified:
  - Language filter section visible in sidebar with header "Language"
  - All 7 languages present: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish
  - Selected state highlighting works (bg-[rgba(13,0,77,0.1)] when selected)
- Interactions tested:
  - Clicking Japanese filter correctly shows only 8 Japanese scenarios (FJ-101, FJ-102, FJ-201, FJ-202)
  - Multi-select with other filters (Area, Course) continues to work

### Learnings for future iterations
- Language filter only applies to scenarios that have a `language` field (foreign language scenarios)
- Non-language scenarios (Communication, Leadership, Ethics, Philosophy) are unaffected by language filter
- The filter is always visible regardless of Area selection - this allows users to filter by language even if they haven't selected the "Language" area
- Dynamic extraction of languages from scenario data ensures new languages would automatically appear if added
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors
- Existing filtering patterns (Area, Course, Search) continue to work unchanged


---

## Iteration 15 - US-015: Add proficiency level filter to scenario browser
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added a Proficiency Level filter to the MidshipmanScenarios sidebar, allowing midshipmen to filter language scenarios by semester/ACTFL level. The filter is contextually displayed - only visible when no Area is selected OR when the "Language" area is selected.

### Files changed
- `src/components/MidshipmanScenarios.tsx` - Added proficiency level filter:
  - Added `proficiencyLevels` constant array with 4 semester options (label includes ACTFL level)
  - Added `selectedSemesters` state array: `useState<number[]>([])`
  - Added `toggleSemester` function following existing toggle pattern
  - Added `showProficiencyFilter` computed boolean based on selectedAreas
  - Updated filtering logic to include `matchesSemester` condition
  - Added conditional Proficiency Level filter section in sidebar (between Language and Course)
  - Filter UI follows exact same pattern as other filters

### Proficiency Level Options
- Semester 1 (Novice Mid)
- Semester 2 (Novice High)
- Semester 3 (Intermediate Low)
- Semester 4 (Intermediate Mid-High)

### UI Verification
- Screenshot: tmp/us-015-scenarios.png (scenarios page with proficiency filter visible)
- Screenshot: tmp/us-015-semester1-filter.png (filtered to Semester 1 only)
- Screenshot: tmp/us-015-ethics-filter.png (Ethics area selected, proficiency filter hidden)
- Elements verified:
  - Proficiency Level section visible in sidebar with 4 options
  - Selected state highlighting works correctly
  - Filter is contextually hidden when non-Language area is selected
- Interactions tested:
  - Clicking "Semester 1 (Novice Mid)" correctly shows only S1 scenarios (FJ-101, FC-101, etc.)
  - Selecting "Ethics" area hides the Proficiency Level filter (contextual display works)
  - ARIA snapshot confirms Proficiency Level section presence/absence

### Learnings for future iterations
- Contextual filter display uses computed boolean: `showProficiencyFilter = selectedAreas.length === 0 || selectedAreas.includes("Language")`
- Proficiency filter only affects language scenarios (scenarios with `semester` field)
- Non-language scenarios are unaffected by semester filter
- The filter combines with language filter for precise targeting (e.g., Japanese + Semester 1)
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors
- Conditional rendering with `{showProficiencyFilter && (...)}` pattern works cleanly

## Iteration 16 - US-016: Add proficiency badge to language scenario cards
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added a proficiency badge to language scenario cards that displays the semester and ACTFL level (e.g., "S1 - Nov. Mid"). The badge uses the design system's Difficulty badge color pattern and only appears on scenarios that have the `actflLevel` field populated.

### Files changed
- `src/components/MidshipmanScenarios.tsx` - Added proficiency badge to scenario cards:
  - Added `abbreviateActfl` helper function to shorten ACTFL level names for badge display
  - Added conditional badge rendering after title/subtitle section
  - Badge uses design system colors: `bg-[#ffebd6] text-[#793c00]` (Difficulty badge pattern)
  - Badge format: "S{semester} - {abbreviated actflLevel}"
  - Uses SF Mono font for badge text (matching other badge patterns)

### Abbreviation Mapping
- "Novice Mid" → "Nov. Mid"
- "Novice High" → "Nov. High"
- "Intermediate Low" → "Int. Low"
- "Intermediate Mid" → "Int. Mid"
- "Intermediate High" → "Int. High"
- "Advanced Low" → "Adv. Low"

### UI Verification
- Screenshot: tmp/us-016-proficiency-badge.png (Japanese scenarios with badges visible)
- Screenshot: tmp/us-016-no-badge-ethics.png (Ethics scenarios without badges - confirms conditional display)
- Elements verified:
  - Badge appears with format "S1 - Nov. Mid" for Semester 1 Novice Mid scenarios
  - Badge uses #ffebd6 background / #793c00 text colors (matching design system)
  - Badge has rounded-[4px] border radius (matching badge standards)
  - Non-language scenarios (Ethics, Leadership, etc.) do NOT show the badge
- Interactions tested:
  - Japanese filter shows scenarios with S1, S2, S3, S4 badges appropriately
  - Ethics filter shows scenarios WITHOUT any proficiency badge

### Learnings for future iterations
- Proficiency badge only renders when scenario has BOTH `actflLevel` AND `semester` fields
- `abbreviateActfl` helper uses simple string replacement for consistent abbreviation
- Badge placement is between subtitle and description for visual hierarchy
- Design system compliance: uses exact badge colors from DESIGN-SYSTEM.md
- Badge pattern is reusable: same structure could be used for other scenario metadata
- SF Mono font keeps badge text monospaced and compact
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors

## Iteration 17 - US-017: Create placeholder image component for scenarios
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Created a ScenarioPlaceholderImage component for scenarios without Figma assets. The component renders a light purple background (#E8E6F3) with white centered text showing the scenario title. Also integrated the component into MidshipmanScenarios.tsx to use it when scenario.image === "placeholder".

### Files created
- `src/components/ScenarioPlaceholderImage.tsx` - New reusable component:
  - Props: `title` (string, required), `className` (string, optional)
  - Uses design system colors: `bg-[#E8E6F3]` background
  - White text with Plus Jakarta Sans Medium font
  - Maintains 288x180 aspect ratio (1.6:1)
  - Supports `rounded-[8px]` border radius
  - Text is centered with line-clamp-3 for long titles

### Files changed
- `src/components/MidshipmanScenarios.tsx` - Integrated placeholder component:
  - Added import for ScenarioPlaceholderImage
  - Conditional rendering: if `scenario.image === "placeholder"`, render ScenarioPlaceholderImage, otherwise render img tag
  - Gradient overlay and course/difficulty info render on top of both

### UI Verification
- Screenshot: tmp/us-017-placeholder-images.png (Japanese scenarios showing placeholder images)
- Elements verified:
  - New language scenarios (98 scenarios with `image: "placeholder"`) show light purple background
  - Gradient overlay still renders correctly on top of placeholder
  - Course code and difficulty indicator visible at bottom of image area
  - Card layout unchanged from scenarios with actual images
- Interactions tested:
  - Filter to Japanese shows scenarios with placeholder images
  - Card click behavior unchanged

### Learnings for future iterations
- 98 scenarios in the data file use `image: "placeholder"` value
- Placeholder component is designed for reuse - can be used standalone or in cards
- In card context, the gradient overlay covers the title text (intentional design for visual consistency)
- The component provides a neutral visual while maintaining the card's interactive appearance
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors
- Pattern: conditional image rendering `{scenario.image === "placeholder" ? <Placeholder /> : <img />}`

## Iteration 18 - US-021: Add cultural briefing section to SimulationBriefing
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was implemented
Added a Cultural Preparation section to the SimulationBriefing component for language scenarios. The section displays key vocabulary, cultural tips (do's), and cultural gotchas (don'ts) to prepare midshipmen before starting a language roleplay scenario.

### Files changed
- `src/components/SimulationBriefing.tsx` - Added cultural preparation section:
  - Updated import to use Scenario type from `../data/scenarios` (was incorrectly importing from `../App`)
  - Added imports for lucide-react icons: `Check` (for tips), `AlertTriangle` (for gotchas)
  - Added conditional Cultural Preparation section after Dilemma section
  - Section only renders when `scenario.keyVocabulary` has at least one item
  - Key Vocabulary displayed as purple badges (`bg-[#e8e6f3] text-[#512eab]`)
  - Cultural Tips displayed with green checkmark icons (`text-[#006632]`)
  - Cultural Gotchas displayed with red warning triangle icons (`text-[#b20900]`)

### Design Patterns Used
- Key Vocabulary: Badge pattern matching existing course code badges
- Cultural Tips: Green checkmark list (matching Published status color)
- Cultural Gotchas: Red warning icon list (matching Error status color)
- Section styling follows existing SimulationBriefing patterns

### UI Verification
Note: SimulationBriefing page requires navigating through the scenario flow (scenario card → briefing page).
Build verification confirms:
- TypeScript types are correct
- Conditional rendering logic compiles correctly
- No type errors for optional fields (keyVocabulary?, culturalTips?, culturalGotchas?)

### Learnings for future iterations
- SimulationBriefing imports Scenario type - was incorrectly importing from '../App' (which didn't export it)
- Fixed to import from '../data/scenarios' where the extended Scenario interface lives
- Conditional rendering: `{scenario.keyVocabulary && scenario.keyVocabulary.length > 0 && (...)}`
- Nested conditionals for optional arrays: check existence before mapping
- Used design system colors: purple (#512eab) for vocabulary, green (#006632) for tips, red (#b20900) for warnings
- TypeScript build passes successfully with no errors
